# AI-Powered Truck Sharing Logistics Platform

## Overview

This project is an **AI-powered marketplace** designed to connect shippers and truck owners, optimizing freight logistics. The platform enables truck owners to monetize empty truck space and helps shippers find cost-effective and efficient shipping options. By leveraging **AI algorithms** for real-time load matching, route optimization, and dynamic pricing, this platform aims to streamline the freight transportation process.

## Key Features

1. **AI-Based Matching System**:
   - Connects shippersâ€™ loads with available trucks based on factors such as location, load type, and delivery timeline.
   
2. **Real-Time Load Matching**:
   - Shippers post load details (e.g., weight, type, destination), while truckers post available space and routes. The system uses AI to match loads with available trucks in real-time.
   
3. **Dynamic Pricing Model**:
   - Implements an AI-driven pricing model based on supply, demand, load size, urgency, and distance to ensure competitive rates.
   
4. **Route Optimization**:
   - Suggests optimal routes using real-time data like traffic conditions, fuel costs, and road restrictions, reducing fuel consumption and improving delivery times.
   
5. **Sustainability Metrics**:
   - Tracks CO2 emissions and provides suggestions for eco-friendly routes to align with sustainability goals.
   
6. **Automated Payment and Documentation**:
   - Handles all transactions and documentation, including contracts and payments, for a seamless experience.
